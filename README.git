(This file does not appear in release tarballs.)

In a release or snapshot tarball of Postgres-XC, documentation files named
INSTALL and HISTORY will appear in this directory.  However, these files are
not stored in git and so will not be present if you are using a git checkout.
If you are using git, you can view the most recent install instructions at:
	http://postgres-xc.sourceforge.net/docs/1_0/installation.html
and the current release notes at:
	http://postgres-xc.sourceforge.net/docs/1_0/release.html

Users compiling from git will also need compatible versions of Bison, Flex,
and Perl, as discussed in the install documentation.  These programs are not
needed when using a tarball, since the files they are needed to build are
already present in the tarball.  (On Windows, however, you need Perl anyway.)
