/*
 *	The magnetic disk storage manager keeps track of open file
 *	descriptors in its own descriptor pool.  This is done to make it
 *	easier to support relations that are larger than the operating
 *	system's file size limit (often 2GBytes).  In order to do that,
 *	we break relations up into "segment" files that are each shorter than
 *	the OS file size limit.  The segment size is set by the RELSEG_SIZE
 *	configuration constant in pg_config.h.
 *
 *	On disk, a relation must consist of consecutively numbered segment
 *	files in the pattern
 *		-- Zero or more full segments of exactly RELSEG_SIZE blocks each
 *		-- Exactly one partial segment of size 0 <= size < RELSEG_SIZE blocks
 *		-- Optionally, any number of inactive segments of size 0 blocks.
 *	The full and partial segments are collectively the "active" segments.
 *	Inactive segments are those that once contained data but are currently
 *	not needed because of an mdtruncate() operation.  The reason for leaving
 *	them present at size zero, rather than unlinking them, is that other
 *	backends and/or the checkpointer might be holding open file references to
 *	such segments.  If the relation expands again after mdtruncate(), such
 *	that a deactivated segment becomes active again, it is important that
 *	such file references still be valid --- else data might get written
 *	out to an unlinked old copy of a segment file that will eventually
 *	disappear.
 *
 *	The file descriptor pointer (md_fd field) stored in the SMgrRelation
 *	cache is, therefore, just the head of a list of MdfdVec objects, one
 *	per segment.  But note the md_fd pointer can be NULL, indicating
 *	relation not open.
 *
 *	Also note that mdfd_chain == NULL does not necessarily mean the relation
 *	doesn't have another segment after this one; we may just not have
 *	opened the next segment yet.  (We could not have "all segments are
 *	in the chain" as an invariant anyway, since another backend could
 *	extend the relation when we weren't looking.)  We do not make chain
 *	entries for inactive segments, however; as soon as we find a partial
 *	segment, we assume that any subsequent segments are inactive.
 *
 *	All MdfdVec objects are palloc'd in the MdCxt memory context.

 *
 * forkNum can be a fork number to delete a specific fork, or InvalidForkNumber
 * to delete all forks.
 *
 * For regular relations, we don't unlink the first segment file of the rel,
 * but just truncate it to zero length, and record a request to unlink it after
 * the next checkpoint.  Additional segments can be unlinked immediately,
 * however.  Leaving the empty file in place prevents that relfilenode
 * number from being reused.  The scenario this protects us from is:
 * 1. We delete a relation (and commit, and actually remove its file).
 * 2. We create a new relation, which by chance gets the same relfilenode as
 *	  the just-deleted one (OIDs must've wrapped around for that to happen).
 * 3. We crash before another checkpoint occurs.
 * During replay, we would delete the file and then recreate it, which is fine
 * if the contents of the file were repopulated by subsequent WAL entries.
 * But if we didn't WAL-log insertions, but instead relied on fsyncing the
 * file after populating it (as for instance CLUSTER and CREATE INDEX do),
 * the contents of the file would be lost forever.  By leaving the empty file
 * until after the next checkpoint, we prevent reassignment of the relfilenode
 * number until it's safe, because relfilenode assignment skips over any
 * existing file.
 *
 * We do not need to go through this dance for temp relations, though, because
 * we never make WAL entries for temp rels, and so a temp rel poses no threat
 * to the health of a regular rel that has taken over its relfilenode number.
 * The fact that temp rels and regular rels have different file naming
 * patterns provides additional safety.
 *
 * All the above applies only to the relation's main fork; other forks can
 * just be removed immediately, since they are not needed to prevent the
 * relfilenode number from being recycled.  Also, we do not carefully
 * track whether other forks have been created or not, but just attempt to
 * unlink them unconditionally; so we should never complain about ENOENT.
 *
 * If isRedo is true, it's unsurprising for the relation to be already gone.
 * Also, we should remove the file immediately instead of queuing a request
 * for later, since during redo there's no possibility of creating a
 * conflicting relation.
 *
 * Note: any failure should be reported as WARNING not ERROR, because
 * we are usually not in a transaction anymore when this is called.
