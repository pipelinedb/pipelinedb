 * lwlock.c
 *	  Lightweight lock manager
 *
 * Lightweight locks are intended primarily to provide mutual exclusion of
 * access to shared-memory data structures.  Therefore, they offer both
 * exclusive and shared lock modes (to support read/write and read-only
 * access to a shared object).  There are few other frammishes.  User-level
 * locking should be done with the full lock manager --- which depends on
 * LWLocks to protect its shared state.
 *
 * In addition to exclusive and shared modes, lightweight locks can be used to
 * wait until a variable changes value.  The variable is initially not set
 * when the lock is acquired with LWLockAcquire, i.e. it remains set to the
 * value it was set to when the lock was released last, and can be updated
 * without releasing the lock by calling LWLockUpdateVar.  LWLockWaitForVar
 * waits for the variable to be updated, or until the lock is free.  When
 * releasing the lock with LWLockReleaseClearVar() the value can be set to an
 * appropriate value for a free lock.  The meaning of the variable is up to
 * the caller, the lightweight lock code just assigns and compares it.

 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * This used to be a pretty straight forward reader-writer lock
 * implementation, in which the internal state was protected by a
 * spinlock. Unfortunately the overhead of taking the spinlock proved to be
 * too high for workloads/locks that were taken in shared mode very
 * frequently. Often we were spinning in the (obviously exclusive) spinlock,
 * while trying to acquire a shared lock that was actually free.
 *
 * Thus a new implementation was devised that provides wait-free shared lock
 * acquisition for locks that aren't exclusively locked.
 *
 * The basic idea is to have a single atomic variable 'lockcount' instead of
 * the formerly separate shared and exclusive counters and to use atomic
 * operations to acquire the lock. That's fairly easy to do for plain
 * rw-spinlocks, but a lot harder for something like LWLocks that want to wait
 * in the OS.
 *
 * For lock acquisition we use an atomic compare-and-exchange on the lockcount
 * variable. For exclusive lock we swap in a sentinel value
 * (LW_VAL_EXCLUSIVE), for shared locks we count the number of holders.
 *
 * To release the lock we use an atomic decrement to release the lock. If the
 * new value is zero (we get that atomically), we know we can/have to release
 * waiters.
 *
 * Obviously it is important that the sentinel value for exclusive locks
 * doesn't conflict with the maximum number of possible share lockers -
 * luckily MAX_BACKENDS makes that easily possible.
 *
 *
 * The attentive reader might have noticed that naively doing the above has a
 * glaring race condition: We try to lock using the atomic operations and
 * notice that we have to wait. Unfortunately by the time we have finished
 * queuing, the former locker very well might have already finished it's
 * work. That's problematic because we're now stuck waiting inside the OS.

 * To mitigate those races we use a two phased attempt at locking:
 *	 Phase 1: Try to do it atomically, if we succeed, nice
 *	 Phase 2: Add ourselves to the waitqueue of the lock
 *	 Phase 3: Try to grab the lock again, if we succeed, remove ourselves from
 *			  the queue
 *	 Phase 4: Sleep till wake-up, goto Phase 1
 *
 * This protects us against the problem from above as nobody can release too
 *	  quick, before we're queued, since after Phase 2 we're already queued.
