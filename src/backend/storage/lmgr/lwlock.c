 * lwlock.c
 *	  Lightweight lock manager
 *
 * Lightweight locks are intended primarily to provide mutual exclusion of
 * access to shared-memory data structures.  Therefore, they offer both
 * exclusive and shared lock modes (to support read/write and read-only
 * access to a shared object).  There are few other frammishes.  User-level
 * locking should be done with the full lock manager --- which depends on
 * LWLocks to protect its shared state.
 *
 * In addition to exclusive and shared modes, lightweight locks can be used
 * to wait until a variable changes value.  The variable is initially set
 * when the lock is acquired with LWLockAcquireWithVar, and can be updated
 * without releasing the lock by calling LWLockUpdateVar.  LWLockWaitForVar
 * waits for the variable to be updated, or until the lock is free.  The
 * meaning of the variable is up to the caller, the lightweight lock code
 * just assigns and compares it.
