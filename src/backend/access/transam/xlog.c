 *
 * To read XLogCtl->LogwrtResult, you must hold either info_lck or
 * WALWriteLock.  To update it, you need to hold both locks.  The point of
 * this arrangement is that the value can be examined by code that already
 * holds WALWriteLock without needing to grab info_lck as well.  In addition
 * to the shared variable, each backend has a private copy of LogwrtResult,
 * which is updated when convenient.
 *
 * The request bookkeeping is simpler: there is a shared XLogCtl->LogwrtRqst
 * (protected by info_lck), but we don't need to cache any copies of it.
 *
 * info_lck is only held long enough to read/update the protected variables,
 * so it's a plain spinlock.  The other locks are held longer (potentially
 * over I/O operations), so we use LWLocks for them.  These locks are:
 *
 * WALBufMappingLock: must be held to replace a page in the WAL buffer cache.
 * It is only held while initializing and changing the mapping.  If the
 * contents of the buffer being replaced haven't been written yet, the mapping
 * lock is released while the write is done, and reacquired afterwards.
 *
 * WALWriteLock: must be held to write WAL buffers to disk (XLogWrite or
 * XLogFlush).
 *
 * ControlFileLock: must be held to read/update control file or create
 * new log file.
 *
 * CheckpointLock: must be held to do a checkpoint or restartpoint (ensures
 * only one checkpointer at a time; currently, with all checkpoints done by
 * the checkpointer, this is just pro forma).

 * Inserting to WAL is protected by a small fixed number of WAL insertion
 * locks. To insert to the WAL, you must hold one of the locks - it doesn't
 * matter which one. To lock out other concurrent insertions, you must hold
 * of them. Each WAL insertion lock consists of a lightweight lock, plus an
 * indicator of how far the insertion has progressed (insertingAt).
 *
 * The insertingAt values are read when a process wants to flush WAL from
 * the in-memory buffers to disk, to check that all the insertions to the
 * region the process is about to write out have finished. You could simply
 * wait for all currently in-progress insertions to finish, but the
 * insertingAt indicator allows you to ignore insertions to later in the WAL,
 * so that you only wait for the insertions that are modifying the buffers
 * you're about to write out.
 *
 * This isn't just an optimization. If all the WAL buffers are dirty, an
 * inserter that's holding a WAL insert lock might need to evict an old WAL
 * buffer, which requires flushing the WAL. If it's possible for an inserter
 * to block on another inserter unnecessarily, deadlock can arise when two
 * inserters holding a WAL insert lock wait for each other to finish their
 * insertion.
 *
 * Small WAL records that don't cross a page boundary never update the value,
 * the WAL record is just copied to the page and the lock is released. But
 * to avoid the deadlock-scenario explained above, the indicator is always

	 *	  reserved space is kept in Insert->CurrBytePos, and is protected by
	 *	  insertpos_lck.
	 *
	 * 2. Copy the record to the reserved WAL space. This involves finding the
	 *	  correct WAL buffer containing the reserved space, and copying the
	 *	  record in place. This can be done concurrently in multiple processes.
	 *
	 * To keep track of which insertions are still in-progress, each concurrent
	 * inserter acquires an insertion lock. In addition to just indicating that
	 * an insertion is in progress, the lock tells others how far the inserter
	 * has progressed. There is a small fixed number of insertion locks,
	 * determined by NUM_XLOGINSERT_LOCKS. When an inserter crosses a page
	 * boundary, it updates the value stored in the lock to the how far it has
	 * inserted, to allow the previous buffer to be flushed.
	 *
	 * Holding onto an insertion lock also protects RedoRecPtr and
	 * fullPageWrites from changing until the insertion is finished.
	 *
	 * Step 2 can usually be done completely in parallel. If the required WAL
	 * page is not initialized yet, you have to grab WALBufMappingLock to
	 * initialize it, but the WAL writer tries to do that ahead of insertions
	 * to avoid that from happening in the critical path.
