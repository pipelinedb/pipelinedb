 *		visibilitymap_pin_ok - check whether correct map page is already pinned
 *		visibilitymap_set	 - set a bit in a previously pinned page

 *		visibilitymap_count  - count number of bits set in visibility map
 *		visibilitymap_truncate	- truncate the visibility map
 *
 * NOTES
 *
 * The visibility map is a bitmap with one bit per heap page. A set bit means
 * that all tuples on the page are known visible to all transactions, and
 * therefore the page doesn't need to be vacuumed. The map is conservative in
 * the sense that we make sure that whenever a bit is set, we know the
 * condition is true, but if a bit is not set, it might or might not be true.
 *
 * Clearing a visibility map bit is not separately WAL-logged.	The callers
 * must make sure that whenever a bit is cleared, the bit is cleared on WAL
 * replay of the updating operation as well.
 *
 * When we *set* a visibility map during VACUUM, we must write WAL.  This may
 * seem counterintuitive, since the bit is basically a hint: if it is clear,
 * it may still be the case that every tuple on the page is visible to all
 * transactions; we just don't know that for certain.  The difficulty is that
 * there are two bits which are typically set together: the PD_ALL_VISIBLE bit
 * on the page itself, and the visibility map bit.	If a crash occurs after the
 * visibility map page makes it to disk and before the updated heap page makes
 * it to disk, redo must set the bit on the heap page.	Otherwise, the next
 * insert, update, or delete on the heap page will fail to realize that the
 * visibility map bit must be cleared, possibly causing index-only scans to
 * return wrong answers.
 *
 * VACUUM will normally skip pages for which the visibility map bit is set;
 * such pages can't contain any dead tuples and therefore don't need vacuuming.
 * The visibility map is not used for anti-wraparound vacuums, because
 * an anti-wraparound vacuum needs to freeze tuples and observe the latest xid
 * present in the table, even on pages that don't have any dead tuples.
 *
 * LOCKING
 *
 * In heapam.c, whenever a page is modified so that not all tuples on the
 * page are visible to everyone anymore, the corresponding bit in the
 * visibility map is cleared. In order to be crash-safe, we need to do this
 * while still holding a lock on the heap page and in the same critical
 * section that logs the page modification. However, we don't want to hold
 * the buffer lock over any I/O that may be required to read in the visibility
 * map page.  To avoid this, we examine the heap page before locking it;
 * if the page-level PD_ALL_VISIBLE bit is set, we pin the visibility map
 * bit.  Then, we lock the buffer.	But this creates a race condition: there
 * is a possibility that in the time it takes to lock the buffer, the
 * PD_ALL_VISIBLE bit gets set.  If that happens, we have to unlock the
 * buffer, pin the visibility map page, and relock the buffer.	This shouldn't
 * happen often, because only VACUUM currently sets visibility map bits,
 * and the race will only occur if VACUUM processes a given page at almost
 * exactly the same time that someone tries to further modify it.
 *
 * To set a bit, you need to hold a lock on the heap page. That prevents
 * the race condition where VACUUM sees that all tuples on the page are
 * visible to everyone, but another backend modifies the page before VACUUM
 * sets the bit in the visibility map.
 *
 * When a bit is set, the LSN of the visibility map page is updated to make
 * sure that the visibility map update doesn't get written to disk before the
 * WAL record of the changes that made it possible to set the bit is flushed.
 * But when a bit is cleared, we don't have to do that because it's always
 * safe to clear a bit in the map from correctness point of view.
