 * snapmgr.c
 *		PostgreSQL snapshot manager
 *
 * We keep track of snapshots in two ways: those "registered" by resowner.c,
 * and the "active snapshot" stack.  All snapshots in either of them live in
 * persistent memory.  When a snapshot is no longer in any of these lists
 * (tracked by separate refcounts on each snapshot), its memory can be freed.
 *
 * The FirstXactSnapshot, if any, is treated a bit specially: we increment its
 * regd_count and count it in RegisteredSnapshots, but this reference is not
 * tracked by a resource owner. We used to use the TopTransactionResourceOwner
 * to track this snapshot reference, but that introduces logical circularity
 * and thus makes it impossible to clean up in a sane fashion.  It's better to
 * handle this reference as an internally-tracked registration, so that this
 * module is entirely lower-level than ResourceOwners.
 *
 * Likewise, any snapshots that have been exported by pg_export_snapshot
 * have regd_count = 1 and are counted in RegisteredSnapshots, but are not
 * tracked by any resource owner.
 *
 * The same is true for historic snapshots used during logical decoding,
 * their lifetime is managed separately (as they life longer as one xact.c
 * transaction).
 *
 * These arrangements let us reset MyPgXact->xmin when there are no snapshots
 * referenced by this transaction.  (One possible improvement would be to be
 * able to advance Xmin when the snapshot with the earliest Xmin is no longer
 * referenced.  That's a bit harder though, it requires more locking, and
 * anyway it should be rather uncommon to keep temporary snapshots referenced
 * for too long.)
