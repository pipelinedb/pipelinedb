 *			PUSHING QUALS DOWN INTO SUBQUERIES
 *****************************************************************************/

/*
 * subquery_is_pushdown_safe - is a subquery safe for pushing down quals?
 *
 * subquery is the particular component query being checked.  topquery
 * is the top component of a set-operations tree (the same Query if no
 * set-op is involved).
 *
 * Conditions checked here:
 *
 * 1. If the subquery has a LIMIT clause, we must not push down any quals,
 * since that could change the set of rows returned.
 *
 * 2. If the subquery contains any window functions, we can't push quals
 * into it, because that could change the results.
 *
 * 3. If the subquery contains EXCEPT or EXCEPT ALL set ops we cannot push
 * quals into it, because that could change the results.
 *
 * 4. If the subquery uses DISTINCT, we cannot push volatile quals into it.
 * This is because upper-level quals should semantically be evaluated only
 * once per distinct row, not once per original row, and if the qual is
 * volatile then extra evaluations could change the results.  (This issue
 * does not apply to other forms of aggregation such as GROUP BY, because
 * when those are present we push into HAVING not WHERE, so that the quals
 * are still applied after aggregation.)
 *
 * In addition, we make several checks on the subquery's output columns to see
 * if it is safe to reference them in pushed-down quals.  If output column k
 * is found to be unsafe to reference, we set safetyInfo->unsafeColumns[k]
 * to TRUE, but we don't reject the subquery overall since column k might not
 * be referenced by some/all quals.  The unsafeColumns[] array will be
 * consulted later by qual_is_pushdown_safe().  It's better to do it this way
 * than to make the checks directly in qual_is_pushdown_safe(), because when
 * the subquery involves set operations we have to check the output
 * expressions in each arm of the set op.
 *
 * Note: pushing quals into a DISTINCT subquery is theoretically dubious:
 * we're effectively assuming that the quals cannot distinguish values that
 * the DISTINCT's equality operator sees as equal, yet there are many
 * counterexamples to that assumption.  However use of such a qual with a
 * DISTINCT subquery would be unsafe anyway, since there's no guarantee which
 * "equal" value will be chosen as the output value by the DISTINCT operation.
 * So we don't worry too much about that.  Another objection is that if the
 * qual is expensive to evaluate, running it for each original row might cost
 * more than we save by eliminating rows before the DISTINCT step.  But it
 * would be very hard to estimate that at this stage, and in practice pushdown
 * seldom seems to make things worse, so we ignore that problem too.
