 * We use fuzzy comparisons so that add_path() can avoid keeping both of
 * a pair of paths that really have insignificantly different cost.
 *
 * The fuzz_factor argument must be 1.0 plus delta, where delta is the
 * fraction of the smaller cost that is considered to be a significant
 * difference.  For example, fuzz_factor = 1.01 makes the fuzziness limit
 * be 1% of the smaller cost.
 *
 * The two paths are said to have "equal" costs if both startup and total
 * costs are fuzzily the same.  Path1 is said to be better than path2 if
 * it has fuzzily better startup cost and fuzzily no worse total cost,
 * or if it has fuzzily better total cost and fuzzily no worse startup cost.
 * Path2 is better than path1 if the reverse holds.  Finally, if one path
 * is fuzzily better than the other on startup cost and fuzzily worse on
 * total cost, we just say that their costs are "different", since neither
 * dominates the other across the whole performance spectrum.
 *
 * If consider_startup is false, then we don't care about keeping paths with
 * good startup cost, so we'll never return COSTS_DIFFERENT.
 *
 * This function also includes special hacks to support a policy enforced
 * by its sole caller, add_path(): paths that have any parameterization
 * cannot win comparisons on the grounds of having cheaper startup cost,
 * since we deem only total cost to be of interest for a parameterized path.

 * add_path
 *	  Consider a potential implementation path for the specified parent rel,
 *	  and add it to the rel's pathlist if it is worthy of consideration.
 *	  A path is worthy if it has a better sort order (better pathkeys) or
 *	  cheaper cost (on either dimension), or generates fewer rows, than any
 *	  existing path that has the same or superset parameterization rels.
 *
 *	  We also remove from the rel's pathlist any old paths that are dominated
 *	  by new_path --- that is, new_path is cheaper, at least as well ordered,
 *	  generates no more rows, and requires no outer rels not required by the
 *	  old path.
 *
 *	  In most cases, a path with a superset parameterization will generate
 *	  fewer rows (since it has more join clauses to apply), so that those two
 *	  figures of merit move in opposite directions; this means that a path of
 *	  one parameterization can seldom dominate a path of another.  But such
 *	  cases do arise, so we make the full set of checks anyway.
 *
 *	  There are two policy decisions embedded in this function, along with
 *	  its sibling add_path_precheck: we treat all parameterized paths as
 *	  having NIL pathkeys, and we ignore their startup costs, so that they
 *	  compete only on parameterization, total cost and rowcount.  This is to
 *	  reduce the number of parameterized paths that are kept.  See discussion
 *	  in src/backend/optimizer/README.
 *
 *	  Another policy that is enforced here is that we only consider cheap
 *	  startup cost to be interesting if parent_rel->consider_startup is true.
 *
 *	  The pathlist is kept sorted by total_cost, with cheaper paths
 *	  at the front.  Within this routine, that's simply a speed hack:
 *	  doing it that way makes it more likely that we will reject an inferior
 *	  path after a few comparisons, rather than many comparisons.
 *	  However, add_path_precheck relies on this ordering to exit early
 *	  when possible.
 *
 *	  NOTE: discarded Path objects are immediately pfree'd to reduce planner
 *	  memory consumption.  We dare not try to free the substructure of a Path,
 *	  since much of it may be shared with other Paths or the query tree itself;
 *	  but just recycling discarded Path nodes is a very useful savings in
 *	  a large join tree.  We can recycle the List nodes of pathlist, too.
 *
 *	  BUT: we do not pfree IndexPath objects, since they may be referenced as
 *	  children of BitmapHeapPaths as well as being paths in their own right.
 *
 * 'parent_rel' is the relation entry to which the path corresponds.
 * 'new_path' is a potential path for parent_rel.
 *
 * Returns nothing, but modifies parent_rel->pathlist.
