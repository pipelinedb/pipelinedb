 *	  built afresh for each pair of input sub-relations we consider, whereas
 *	  the join list need only be computed once for any join RelOptInfo.
 *	  The join list is fully determined by the set of rels making up the
 *	  joinrel, so we should get the same results (up to ordering) from any
 *	  candidate pair of sub-relations.  But the restriction list is whatever
 *	  is not handled in the sub-relations, so it depends on which
 *	  sub-relations are considered.
 *
 *	  If a join clause from an input relation refers to base rels still not
 *	  present in the joinrel, then it is still a join clause for the joinrel;
 *	  we put it into the joininfo list for the joinrel.  Otherwise,
 *	  the clause is now a restrict clause for the joined relation, and we
 *	  return it to the caller of build_joinrel_restrictlist() to be stored in
 *	  join paths made from this pair of sub-relations.  (It will not need to
 *	  be considered further up the join tree.)
 *
 *	  In many case we will find the same RestrictInfos in both input
 *	  relations' joinlists, so be careful to eliminate duplicates.
 *	  Pointer equality should be a sufficient test for dups, since all
 *	  the various joinlist entries ultimately refer to RestrictInfos
 *	  pushed into them by distribute_restrictinfo_to_rels().

 * 'outer_rel' and 'inner_rel' are a pair of relations that can be joined

 *
 * build_joinrel_restrictlist() returns a list of relevant restrictinfos,
 * whereas build_joinrel_joinlist() stores its results in the joinrel's
 * joininfo list.  One or the other must accept each given clause!
 *
 * NB: Formerly, we made deep(!) copies of each input RestrictInfo to pass
 * up to the join relation.  I believe this is no longer necessary, because
