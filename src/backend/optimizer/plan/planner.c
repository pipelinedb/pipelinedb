 * just below the first WindowAgg.  This list must contain all values needed
 * to evaluate the window functions, compute the final target list, and
 * perform any required final sort step.  If multiple WindowAggs are needed,
 * each intermediate one adds its window function results onto this tlist;
 * only the topmost WindowAgg computes the actual desired target list.

 * into their component variables.  But we do not want to flatten window
 * PARTITION BY/ORDER BY clauses, since that might result in multiple
 * evaluations of them, which would be bad (possibly even resulting in
 * inconsistent answers, if they contain volatile functions).  Also, we must
 * not flatten GROUP BY clauses that were left unflattened by
 * make_subplanTargetList, because we may no longer have access to the
 * individual Vars in them.
