 *
 * unix_latch.c
 *	  Routines for inter-process latches
 *
 * The Unix implementation uses the so-called self-pipe trick to overcome
 * the race condition involved with select() and setting a global flag
 * in the signal handler. When a latch is set and the current process
 * is waiting for it, the signal handler wakes up the select() in
 * WaitLatch by writing a byte to a pipe. A signal by itself doesn't
 * interrupt select() on all platforms, and even on platforms where it
 * does, a signal that arrives just before the select() call does not
 * prevent the select() from entering sleep. An incoming byte on a pipe
 * however reliably interrupts the sleep, and causes select() to return
 * immediately even if the signal arrives before select() begins.
 *
 * (Actually, we prefer poll() over select() where available, but the
 * same comments apply to it.)
 *
 * When SetLatch is called from the same process that owns the latch,
 * SetLatch writes the byte directly to the pipe. If it's owned by another
 * process, SIGUSR1 is sent and the signal handler in the waiting process
 * writes the byte to the pipe on behalf of the signaling process.
