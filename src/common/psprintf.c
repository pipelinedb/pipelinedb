 * psprintf
 *

 * and return it in an allocated-on-demand buffer.  The buffer is allocated
 * with palloc in the backend, or malloc in frontend builds.  Caller is
 * responsible to free the buffer when no longer needed, if appropriate.
 *
 * Errors are not returned to the caller, but are reported via elog(ERROR)
 * in the backend, or printf-to-stderr-and-exit() in frontend builds.
 * One should therefore think twice about using this in libpq.

 * pvsnprintf
 *
 * Attempt to format text data under the control of fmt (an sprintf-style
 * format string) and insert it into buf (which has length len, len > 0).
 *
 * If successful, return the number of bytes emitted, not counting the
 * trailing zero byte.  This will always be strictly less than len.
 *
 * If there's not enough space in buf, return an estimate of the buffer size
 * needed to succeed (this *must* be more than the given len, else callers
 * might loop infinitely).
 *
 * Other error cases do not return, but exit via elog(ERROR) or exit().
 * Hence, this shouldn't be used inside libpq.
 *
 * This function exists mainly to centralize our workarounds for
 * non-C99-compliant vsnprintf implementations.  Generally, any call that
 * pays any attention to the return value should go through here rather
 * than calling snprintf or vsnprintf directly.
 *
 * Note that the semantics of the return value are not exactly C99's.
 * First, we don't promise that the estimated buffer size is exactly right;
 * callers must be prepared to loop multiple times to get the right size.
 * Second, we return the recommended buffer size, not one less than that;
 * this lets overflow concerns be handled here rather than in the callers.
