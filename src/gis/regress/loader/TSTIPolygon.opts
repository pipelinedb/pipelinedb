# You cannot create a test tablespace because tablespaces need to be directories that
# are owned by the postgres user, which is rarely the same as the user running the test,
# and you can't chown without sudo, so we gave up on trying to have a test that proves
# the -T and -X parameters work.  However we can at least test that they don't cause
# any problems, which is what this test is for.
-T pg_default -X pg_default
