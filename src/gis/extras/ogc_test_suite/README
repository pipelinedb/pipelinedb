This test suite was originally downloaded from 
http://www.opengeospatial.org/resources/?page=testing&view=sfsql
and legal adaptations necessary for PostGIS were added to allow it
to run.

- All tests must be run in a database named 'ogc' in order for the 
  AddGeometryColumn() function calls to work.

  createdb ogc
  createlang plpgsql ogc
  psql ogc < ../../postgis.sql

  psql -a -f 1_schema.sql ogc >& 1_output.txt
  psql -a -f 2_queries.sql ogc >& 2_output.txt
  psql -a -f 3_cleanup.sql ogc >& 3_output.txt

- Load the test files in order. File 2 has the actual tests, with the
  correct answers for each test in the comments.
