Todo for PostGIS 1.0 compatible JDBC classes

- even more Testing, especialy against different postgis, 
  pgjdbc and postgresql releases.
  
- Use JUnit for testing (maven)

- Unify the build of app java projects -> maven

- Handling of length() - esp. with modifying the geometries

- Handling of hashCode() - esp. with modifying the geometries

- Test correctness of toString() and getValue() for compatibility reasons

- See where the code can be cleaned and leaned.

- Finish JTS support

- Creating a sane extension interface for pgjdbc that allows binary
  transfers and convince upstream to use it, then create support for it.

- Possibly adding server side code to support plJava
  http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/pljava/projdisplay.php

- Rework the BinaryParser/BinaryWriter to work on SQLInput/SQLOutput 
  instances, as well as reworking ValueGetter/ValueSetter to implment those interfaces.
