-- These are reserved for functions where the they are changed to use default args  
-- This is installed after the new functions are installed
-- We don't have any of these yet for topology
-- The reason we put these after install is 
-- you can't drop a function that is used by sql functions
-- without forcing a drop on those as well which may cause issues with user functions.  
-- This allows us to CREATE OR REPLACE those in general topology.sql
-- without dropping them.
