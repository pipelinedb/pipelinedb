# By convention, we put no more than twenty tests in any one parallel group;
# this limits the number of connections needed to run the tests.
# ----------

# run tablespace by itself, and first, because it forces a checkpoint;
# we'd prefer not to have checkpoints later in the tests because that
# interferes with crash-recovery testing.
