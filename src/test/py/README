To install the dependencies necessary to run this test suite, run:

sudo pip install -r ./requirements.txt

If you'd prefer to not install these packages system wide, you can
use virtualenv or install them in a specific directory:

pip install -r ./requirements.txt -t /local/path

Just make sure they're somewhere on your PYTHONPATH. To run the test
suite after the dependencies have been installed properly, run:

make check

or,

py.test

See http://pytest.org/latest/usage.html for more information on
how to use py.test for more selective and fancy test running.
