	 * which values appear about twice on the average could be represented
	 * by stadistinct = -0.5).	Because the number-of-rows statistic in
	 * pg_class may be updated more frequently than pg_statistic is, it's
	 * important to be able to describe such situations as a multiple of
	 * the number of rows, rather than a fixed number of distinct values.

 * Currently, five statistical slot "kinds" are defined by core PostgreSQL,

 * future to help cope with non-scalar datatypes.  Also, custom data types
 * can define their own "kind" codes by mutual agreement between a custom
 * typanalyze routine and the selectivity estimation functions of the type's
 * operators.
 *
 * Code reading the pg_statistic relation should not assume that a particular
 * data "kind" will appear in any particular slot.	Instead, search the
 * stakind fields to see if the desired data is available.	(The standard
 * function get_attstatsslot() may be used for this.)

 * shall be ordered in decreasing frequency.  Note that since the arrays are

 * A "histogram" slot describes the distribution of scalar data.  staop is
 * the OID of the "<" operator that describes the sort ordering.  (In theory,
 * more than one histogram could appear, if a datatype has more than one
 * useful sort operator.)  stavalues contains M (>=2) non-null values that
 * divide the non-null column data values into M-1 bins of approximately equal
 * population.	The first stavalues item is the MIN and the last is the MAX.
 * stanumbers is not used and should be NULL.  IMPORTANT POINT: if an MCV
 * slot is also provided, then the histogram describes the data distribution
 * *after removing the values listed in MCV* (thus, it's a "compressed
 * histogram" in the technical parlance).  This allows a more accurate
 * representation of the distribution of a column with some very-common
 * values.	In a column with only a few distinct values, it's possible that
 * the MCV list describes the entire data population; in this case the
 * histogram reduces to empty and should be omitted.
 */
#define STATISTIC_KIND_HISTOGRAM  2

/*
 * A "correlation" slot describes the correlation between the physical order
 * of table tuples and the ordering of data values of this column, as seen
 * by the "<" operator identified by staop.  (As with the histogram, more
 * than one entry could theoretically appear.)	stavalues is not used and
 * should be NULL.	stanumbers contains a single entry, the correlation
 * coefficient between the sequence of data values and the sequence of
 * their actual tuple positions.  The coefficient ranges from +1 to -1.

/*
 * A "most common elements" slot is similar to a "most common values" slot,
 * except that it stores the most common non-null *elements* of the column
 * values.	This is useful when the column datatype is an array or some other
 * type with identifiable elements (for instance, tsvector).  staop contains
 * the equality operator appropriate to the element type.  stavalues contains
 * the most common element values, and stanumbers their frequencies.  Unlike
 * MCV slots, frequencies are measured as the fraction of non-null rows the
 * element value appears in, not the frequency of all rows.  Also unlike
 * MCV slots, the values are sorted into the element type's default order
 * (to support binary search for a particular value).  Since this puts the
 * minimum and maximum frequencies at unpredictable spots in stanumbers,
 * there are two extra members of stanumbers, holding copies of the minimum
 * and maximum frequencies.  Optionally, there can be a third extra member,
 * which holds the frequency of null elements (expressed in the same terms:
 * the fraction of non-null rows that contain at least one null element).  If
 * this member is omitted, the column is presumed to contain no null elements.
 *
 * Note: in current usage for tsvector columns, the stavalues elements are of
 * type text, even though their representation within tsvector is not
 * exactly text.

/*
 * A "distinct elements count histogram" slot describes the distribution of
 * the number of distinct element values present in each row of an array-type
 * column.	Only non-null rows are considered, and only non-null elements.
 * staop contains the equality operator appropriate to the element type.
 * stavalues is not used and should be NULL.  The last member of stanumbers is
 * the average count of distinct element values over all non-null rows.  The
 * preceding M (>=2) members form a histogram that divides the population of
 * distinct-elements counts into M-1 bins of approximately equal population.
 * The first of these is the minimum observed count, and the last the maximum.

#define STATISTIC_KIND_DECHIST	5

/*
 * A "length histogram" slot describes the distribution of range lengths in
 * rows of a range-type column. stanumbers contains a single entry, the
 * fraction of empty ranges. stavalues is a histogram of non-empty lengths, in
 * a format similar to STATISTIC_KIND_HISTOGRAM: it contains M (>=2) range
 * values that divide the column data values into M-1 bins of approximately
 * equal population. The lengths are stores as float8s, as measured by the

 * the column data values into M-1 bins of approximately equal population.
 * Unlike a regular scalar histogram, this is actually two histograms combined
 * into a single array, with the lower bounds of each value forming a
 * histogram of lower bounds, and the upper bounds a histogram of upper
 * bounds.	Only non-NULL, non-empty ranges are included.
