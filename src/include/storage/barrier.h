/*
 * A compiler barrier need not (and preferably should not) emit any actual
 * machine code, but must act as an optimization fence: the compiler must not
 * reorder loads or stores to main memory around the barrier.  However, the
 * CPU may still reorder loads or stores at runtime, if the architecture's
 * memory model permits this.
 *
 * A memory barrier must act as a compiler barrier, and in addition must
 * guarantee that all loads and stores issued prior to the barrier are
 * completed before any loads or stores issued after the barrier.  Unless
 * loads and stores are totally ordered (which is not the case on most
 * architectures) this requires issuing some sort of memory fencing
 * instruction.
 *
 * A read barrier must act as a compiler barrier, and in addition must
 * guarantee that any loads issued prior to the barrier are completed before
 * any loads issued after the barrier.	Similarly, a write barrier acts
 * as a compiler barrier, and also orders stores.  Read and write barriers
 * are thus weaker than a full memory barrier, but stronger than a compiler
 * barrier.  In practice, on machines with strong memory ordering, read and
 * write barriers may require nothing more than a compiler barrier.
 *
 * For an introduction to using memory barriers within the PostgreSQL backend,
 * see src/backend/storage/lmgr/README.barrier
