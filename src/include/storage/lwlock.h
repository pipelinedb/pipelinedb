 * other identifying information in the lock itself, but since it's common
 * to have many nearly-identical locks (e.g. one per buffer) this would end
 * up wasting significant amounts of memory.  Instead, each lwlock stores a
 * tranche ID which tells us which array it's part of.  Based on that, we can
 * figure out where the lwlock lies within the array using the data structure
 * shown below; the lock is then identified based on the tranche name and
 * computed array index.  We need the array stride because the array might not
 * be an array of lwlocks, but rather some larger data structure that includes
 * one or more lwlocks per element.

 * Prior to PostgreSQL 9.4, every lightweight lock in the system was stored

 * store LWLocks elsewhere in the main shared memory segment or in a dynamic
 * shared memory segment.  In the main array, we force the array stride to
 * be a power of 2, which saves a few cycles in indexing, but more importantly
 * also ensures that individual LWLocks don't cross cache line boundaries.
 * This reduces cache contention problems, especially on AMD Opterons.
 * (Of course, we have to also ensure that the array start address is suitably
 * aligned.)
 *
 * On a 32-bit platforms a LWLock will these days fit into 16 bytes, but since
 * that didn't use to be the case and cramming more lwlocks into a cacheline
 * might be detrimental performancewise we still use 32 byte alignment
 * there. So, both on 32 and 64 bit platforms, it should fit into 32 bytes
 * unless slock_t is really big.  We allow for that just in case.
