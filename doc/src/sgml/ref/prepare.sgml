  <title>Description</title>

  <para>
   <command>PREPARE</command> creates a prepared statement. A prepared
   statement is a server-side object that can be used to optimize
   performance. When the <command>PREPARE</command> statement is
   executed, the specified statement is parsed, analyzed, and rewritten.
   When an <command>EXECUTE</command> command is subsequently
   issued, the prepared statement is planned and executed.  This division
   of labor avoids repetitive parse analysis work, while allowing
   the execution plan to depend on the specific parameter values supplied.
  </para>

  <para>
   Prepared statements can take parameters: values that are
   substituted into the statement when it is executed. When creating
   the prepared statement, refer to parameters by position, using
   <literal>$1</>, <literal>$2</>, etc. A corresponding list of
   parameter data types can optionally be specified. When a
   parameter's data type is not specified or is declared as
   <literal>unknown</literal>, the type is inferred from the context
   in which the parameter is used (if possible). When executing the
   statement, specify the actual values for these parameters in the
   <command>EXECUTE</command> statement.  Refer to <xref
   linkend="sql-execute"> for more
   information about that.
  </para>

  <para>
   Prepared statements only last for the duration of the current
   database session. When the session ends, the prepared statement is
   forgotten, so it must be recreated before being used again. This
   also means that a single  prepared statement cannot be used by
   multiple simultaneous database clients; however, each client can create
   their own prepared statement to use.  Prepared statements can be
   manually cleaned up using the <xref linkend="sql-deallocate"> command.
  </para>

  <para>
   Prepared statements have the largest performance advantage when a
   single session is being used to execute a large number of similar
   statements. The performance difference will be particularly
   significant if the statements are complex to plan or rewrite, for
   example, if the query involves a join of many tables or requires
   the application of several rules. If the statement is relatively simple
   to plan and rewrite but relatively expensive to execute, the
   performance advantage of prepared statements will be less noticeable.

     <para>
      An arbitrary name given to this particular prepared

      subsequently used to execute or deallocate a previously prepared
      statement.

   <varlistentry>
    <term><replaceable class="PARAMETER">data_type</replaceable></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The data type of a parameter to the prepared statement.  If the
      data type of a particular parameter is unspecified or is
      specified as <literal>unknown</literal>, it will be inferred
      from the context in which the parameter is used. To refer to the
      parameters in the prepared statement itself, use
      <literal>$1</literal>, <literal>$2</literal>, etc.

  <title>Notes</title>

  <para>
   If a prepared statement is executed enough times, the server may eventually
   decide to save and re-use a generic plan rather than re-planning each time.
   This will occur immediately if the prepared statement has no parameters;
   otherwise it occurs only if the generic plan appears to be not much more
   expensive than a plan that depends on specific parameter values.
   Typically, a generic plan will be selected only if the query's performance
   is estimated to be fairly insensitive to the specific parameter values
   supplied.
  </para>

  <para>
   To examine the query plan <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> is using
   for a prepared statement, use <xref linkend="sql-explain">.
   If a generic plan is in use, it will contain parameter symbols
   <literal>$<replaceable>n</></literal>, while a custom plan will have the
   current actual parameter values substituted into it.
  </para>

  <para>
   For more information on query planning and the statistics collected
   by <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> for that purpose, see
   the <xref linkend="sql-analyze">
   documentation.
  </para>

  <para>
   Although the main point of a prepared statement is to avoid repeated parse
   analysis and planning of the statement, <productname>PostgreSQL</> will
   force re-analysis and re-planning of the statement before using it
   whenever database objects used in the statement have undergone
   definitional (DDL) changes since the previous use of the prepared
   statement.  Also, if the value of <xref linkend="guc-search-path"> changes
   from one use to the next, the statement will be re-parsed using the new
   <varname>search_path</>.  (This latter behavior is new as of
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 9.3.)  These rules make use of a
   prepared statement semantically almost equivalent to re-submitting the
   same query text over and over, but with a performance benefit if no object
   definitions are changed, especially if the best plan remains the same
   across uses.  An example of a case where the semantic equivalence is not
   perfect is that if the statement refers to a table by an unqualified name,
   and then a new table of the same name is created in a schema appearing
   earlier in the <varname>search_path</>, no automatic re-parse will occur
   since no object used in the statement changed.  However, if some other
   change forces a re-parse, the new table will be referenced in subsequent
   uses.

  <para>
   Create a prepared statement for an <command>INSERT</command>
   statement, and then execute it:
<programlisting>
PREPARE fooplan (int, text, bool, numeric) AS
    INSERT INTO foo VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4);
EXECUTE fooplan(1, 'Hunter Valley', 't', 200.00);
</programlisting>

  <para>
   Create a prepared statement for a <command>SELECT</command>
   statement, and then execute it:
<programlisting>
PREPARE usrrptplan (int) AS
    SELECT * FROM users u, logs l WHERE u.usrid=$1 AND u.usrid=l.usrid
    AND l.date = $2;
EXECUTE usrrptplan(1, current_date);
</programlisting>

   Note that the data type of the second parameter is not specified,
   so it is inferred from the context in which <literal>$2</> is used.

  <para>
   The SQL standard includes a <command>PREPARE</command> statement,
   but it is only for use in embedded SQL. This version of the
   <command>PREPARE</command> statement also uses a somewhat different
   syntax.
