Contributing
============

We're stoked you want to contribute to PipelineDB! You can help us in a few different ways:

- [Create an issue](https://github.com/pipelinedb/pipelinedb/issues/new) to report a bug or suggest an improvement.
- Improve the [documentation](https://github.com/pipelinedb/docs).
- Submit a code patch for an existing issue.

Please rebase your pull request and squash all commits into a single commit before submitting a pull request. edx has a great [write-up](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request) on how to rebase a pull request. Try to make your commit message informative and concise.
